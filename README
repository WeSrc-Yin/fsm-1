Finite State Machine code
Adam Risi

Using this code This code is presented as if it were a library, but it
isn't really meant to be used as one. Just copy the 2 files (fsm.c and
fsm.h) into your own project, then use it from there. Examples of how
to make your own FSM are in the examples directory.

If you find this code helpful, please email ajrisi@gmail.com with your
notes. I am always willing to give advice if you get stuck somewhere!
